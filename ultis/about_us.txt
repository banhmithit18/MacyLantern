<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>After 10 long years of studying and working in Ho Chi Minh City, a bustling city in Vietnam, Macy and Kenny decided to return to Hoi An to embark on a new journey. In 2014, they chose to open a small souvenir shop in the heart of the ancient town, offering a diverse range of wooden products.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Exchange</strong></p>

<p>During their time in the souvenir business, they had the opportunity to meet customers from different continents who visited Hoi An. Inspired by these cultural exchanges and with a desire to provide convenient shopping experiences for international tourists, they decided to expand their online sales channels.</p>

<p><strong>Preserving Tradition</strong></p>

<p>With the aim of breathing new life into the long-standing traditional craft of their homeland, Macy and Kenny chose Hoi An lanterns as their flagship product, giving rise to the brand name Macy Lantern. Macy Lantern became a symbol of creativity, representing the desire to infuse fresh ideas into the age-old traditions. The lanterns not only serve as decorative items for modern spaces but also hold precious memories for special occasions, creating a unique and unforgettable touch in people&#39;s lives.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>

<p>Macy Lantern is born out of a passion for exploration, development, and celebration of the unique cultural heritage of East Asia. Macy and Kenny dream of building a brand that caters to the diverse needs of customers, drawing inspiration from Eastern cultures and being responsive to the ever-changing modern world.</p>
